# PyCity Schools Analysis
The average math and reading scores stay consistent across all grade levels when grouped by schools.

Math passing rates are consistently lower across every metric, but the differences (gap) between math and reading passing rates are greater among the lower performing schools, followed by the larger schools.

The top five schools are all charter while the bottom five are district schools.

In general (one exception), per-student spending is higher at the bottom performing schools than at the top performing schools.

Schools that have lower than 2000 students have higher passing rates than those with over 2000 students; this translates into a ratio comparision of 95% to 75%. The same pattern is seen with high and low-per-student spending brackets and district versus charter schools.
